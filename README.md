# UMinnesotaCyberSecurityBootCamp

In this repository you will see all of my work from a 6 month Cybersecurity bootcamp through the University of Minnesota, this repository will serve as a portfolio of work to provide to potential employers as well as a reference for those that will be going through this program or other programs. I hope to give good insight to those like myself that are trying to change careers!
